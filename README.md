# Artificial Intelligence in Predictive Health and Laboratory Research
This repository supports the AI in Predictive Health and Laboratory Research workshop jointly organized by Notre Dame of Maryland University School of Pharmacy and Johns Hopkins University. Participants engage in real-world AI use cases in healthcare and laboratory settings, from cleaning structured health data to analyzing stem cell images using ImageJ and training machine learning models to predict drug responses.

## Workshop Organizers:

- Dr. Rosy Joshi-Mukherjee (Notre Dame of Maryland University School of Pharmacy)
- Dr. Sherry Moore (Notre Dame of Maryland University School of Pharmacy)
